# Core Project Spec

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the individual project specification that you will be working on during the training. This project will involve concepts from all core training modules; more specifically, this will involve:

* Agile & Project Management
* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals
* Java SE/EE
* Front-End Development
* Automated Testing
The individual project can be on any subject you deem fit of encapsulating all aspects of the aforementioned modules. This could be a business case, such as a library or supermarket system, or something to do with a hobby of yours â€“ as long as the application is CRUD functional.

This is purposefully open as we want to endorse creativity and give you an opportunity to do a project that you have full command over.

Your front-end and back-end must be linked together and fully functional, please bear this in mind when organising your time.



## Objective
The overall objective of the project is the following:

To create an OOP-based application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
More specifically, you are required to create a full-stack web application following the enterprise architecture model:

* An application back-end developed using Java (Spring Boot framework).
* A test suite utilising JUnit and Mockito for integration and unit tests of the back-end as well as Selenium for automated front-end tests
* A managed MySQL database hosted locally or within a cloud provider examined during Cloud Fundamentals module.
* A front-end developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
* If you wish to use any technologies which have not been covered with the training, you must consult with your trainer first.

You must plan the approach you will take to complete this project using project management and design technologies you have learnt.



## Scope
The requirements set for the project are below. Note that these are a minimum set of requirements and can be added onto during the duration of the project.

The requirements of the project are as follows:

* A project management board (Kanban board on Jira) with full expansion on user stories, acceptance criteria and tasks for the project.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System (GitHub) using the Feature Branch Model: main/dev/features
* A Risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project time frame.
* A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 entities, to demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a relationship with an ERD.
* A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, that you have covered during training that meets the requirements set on your Kanban Board with a functioning front-end website and integrated APIs.
* A functional application front-end which connects to the back-end API.
* A build of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool.
* Code ran through a static analysis tool (SonarQube), with relevant refactoring of your code according to analysis smells, bugs and vulnerabilities.
* Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must also meet 80% test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.
* You should consider the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as you plan your project, complete all the requirements above before you add extra functionality that is not specified above.



## Constraints
The time constraint of this application will be discussed when the specification is given out, as this can fluctuate based on several factors.

The other constraint for this is certain technology that needs to be used. The application needs to utilise the technology discussed during the training modules. The tech stack required would be the following:

* Version Control System - Git
* Source Code Management - GitHub
* Kanban Board - Jira
* Database - MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or cloud hosted)
* Back-end Programming Language - Java
* API Development Platform - Spring
* Front-end web technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Static Analysis - SonarQube
* Build Tool - Maven
* Unit Testing - JUnit & Mockito
* Integration Testing - JUnit
* Automated Testing - Selenium



## Deliverable
The final deliverable for this project is the completed application with full documentation around utilisation of supporting tools, this will require a fully functional application.

You will be required to present your work to at least one trainer; this may be your course leader, another trainer or several trainers. This will take the form of a presentation of work lasting 15 minutes, plus a 5-minute Q&A session.

You will be required to utilise the Feature-Branch Model and to push a working copy of your code to main branch for the marking of this project.

You will be required to include all supporting documentation for your project within your remote repository at close-of-business (17:30) on the day of presenting your project.
